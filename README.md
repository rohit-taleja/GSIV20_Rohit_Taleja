Steps to run this project:

1. Please add API_KEY  in .env file
2. Run command npm install
3. Run command npm start



please not that I have not used the redux beacuse It was not requred for this application and this code can improve a lot but due to time constraint i am able to do this only.
If I got selected I can explain each concept of react in depth.
